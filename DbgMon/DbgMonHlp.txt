                                V5.0


For: Windows XP and later
Released: February 1997-2010

What Is It?
------------
Driver writers often include DbgPrint(...) statements in
their code for debugging purposes.  Traditionally, the only
way to view these messages was by setting up a debugger (such
as WinDbg or Soft Ice for NT) -- This caused the messages
written with DbgPrint(...) in the driver to appear in the
debugger's output window.

OSR's DebugMon utility will capture and display DbgPrint(...)
messages that are written by drivers running on the
same system as DebugMon.  Each output line is sequence
numbered and time-stamped.  Output may optionally be written
to a file.

What is new?
------------
In this version of DebugMon we've added the ability to dynamically
set the Debug filtering flags so that you turn on Debug output in
W2K3 and later systems without having to set registry variables or
use WinDbg commands.   Look under the Events menu item for the new
"Set DbgPrint Flags" Dialog.   This dialog will allow you to select
the debug flags to turn on, their level and whether to enable or 
disable them.

How Does It Work?
------------------
DebugMon is implemented via a small NT standard kernel mode
driver and a user-mode GUI utility.  The kernel mode driver
intercepts DbgPrint(...) requests before they are forwarded
on to kernel debuggers.

By default, DebugMon displays the messages it receives and
does *not* forward them on to a kernel debugger that might
be running.  If you want DbgPrint(...) messages to be
displayed by DebugMon AND passed through to any debugger
that might be running click on Events\Passthrough.


How To Install
--------------
The installation procedure couldn't be simpler.  Just copy
the images to a local (NON-network) drive on the system on
which you wish to monitor debug output.  To display
DbgPrint(...) messages simply execute DebugMon.exe.  The
DbgSys.Sys driver is dynamically installed and loaded when
you run DebugMon, and is removed when you exit from the
DebugMon GUI application
